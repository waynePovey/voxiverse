# voxiverse

A voxel game engine written in Java using LWJGL to recreate some classic 2D pixel games of my childhood into a 3D voxel game...and most importantly to help me to learn to code.

Special thanks to Antonio Hern√°ndez Bejarano and lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook whose tutorials and book have helped me a great deal.
