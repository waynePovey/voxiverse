# voxiverse

A voxel game engine written in Java using LWJGL to recreate some classic 2D games of my childhood...and more importantly to help me to learn to code.
Special thanks to Antonio Hern√°ndez Bejarano and lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook https://github.com/lwjglgamedev/lwjglbook whose tutorials and book have helped me a great deal.
